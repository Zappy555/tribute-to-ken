              <h2>Here's a timeline of Ken Saro-Wiwa's life:</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>Born in 1941 to Jim Wiwa in Bori, Rivers State Nigeria</li>
                  <li>Primary education was at a Native Authority school in Bori, secondary school at Government College Umuahia.</li>
                  <li>On completion of secondary education, he obtained a scholarship to study English at the University of Ibadan.</li>
                  <li>He briefly became a teaching assistant at the University of Lagos and later at University of Nigeria, Nsukka.</li>
                  <li>In the early 1970s Saro-Wiwa served as the Regional Commissioner for Education in the Rivers State Cabinet, but was dismissed in 1973 because of his support for Ogoni autonomy.</li>
                  <li>In the late 1970s, he established a number of successful business ventures in retail and real estate, and during the 1980s concentrated primarily on his writing, journalism and television production.</li>
                  <li>In 1977, he became involved in the political arena running as the candidate to represent Ogoni in the Constituent Assembly. Saro-Wiwa lost the election in a narrow margin.</li>
                  <li>In 1990, Saro-Wiwa began devoting most of his time to human rights and environmental causes, particularly in Ogoniland. Became leader of Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), which advocated for the rights of the Ogoni people.</li>
                  <li>In 1992, Saro-Wiwa was imprisoned for several months, without trial, by the Nigerian military government.</li>
                  <li>In January 1993, MOSOP organised peaceful marches of around 300,000 Ogoni people – more than half of the Ogoni population – through four Ogoni urban centres, drawing international attention to their people's plight. The same year the Nigerian government occupied the region militarily.</li>
                  <li>Saro-Wiwa was Vice Chair of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) General Assembly from 1993 to 1995.</li>
                  <li>Saro-Wiwa was arrested again and detained by Nigerian authorities in June 1993 but was released after a month.</li>
                  <li>On 21 May 1994 four Ogoni chiefs were brutally murdered. Saro-Wiwa was arrested and accused of incitement to them. He denied the charges but was imprisoned for over a year before being found guilty and sentenced to death by a specially convened tribunal along with eight other MOSOP leaders who, along with Saro-Wiwa, became known as the Ogoni Nine.</li>
                  <li>On 10 November 1995, Saro-Wiwa and the rest of the Ogoni Nine were killed by hanging by military personnel. They were buried in Port Harcourt Cemetery.</li>
                  <li>His execution attracted both local and international condemnation and was widely criticised by human rights organisations. Nigeria was banned from the United Nations.</li>
